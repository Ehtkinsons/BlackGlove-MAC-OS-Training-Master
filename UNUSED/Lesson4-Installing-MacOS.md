* Installation considerations
	+ The macOS installation process is fairly straightforward
	+ Boot from the installation media and click next a series of times
	+ Installing through the app store is practically automatic
	+ There are some customizations available
	+ Especially true with a clean install
* Performing a Clean Install of macOS
	1. Boot from installation media
		+ Hold *Option* during boot if necessary
	2. Select your preferred language
	3. Choose *Install macOS*
		+ *Install macOS* - Perform an installation.
	4. Select *Continue*
	5. Review and accept the EULA by clicking *Agree*
	6. Select a hard drive to install to
		+ Note that the installation media may show up also
	7. Select *Install* to complete the installation
* macOS Disk Layout
	+ A file system "container" is created
	+ Virtual volumes are created to store the OS and user data on one drive
	+ Finding information is easier as there is one place to look
	+ Upgrades are more simple as files are in their default location
	+ Most common type of installation
* Multiple partitions can facilitate several scenarios
	+ Running multiple OSes side-by-side (dual-boot)
	+ Separating user and system data
	+ Restricting file growth
	+ Isolating data for easy backup selection
	+ Providing for alternate file systems
* Bootcamp
	+ Multiple partitions allow for multiple operating systems
	+ Bootcamp leverages this to enable macOS and Windows to coexist
	+ Separate partitions ensure one OS does not damage the other's files
	+ Separate partitions allow for each OS to use their native file system
* Considerations
	+ Separating user and system data can make it more simple to locate information
	+ Backups are smaller and faster because you only backup the user data disk
	+ Can create problems with some software as well as future upgrades
* Installer Log 
 	+ Available in the macOS Installer menu bar
