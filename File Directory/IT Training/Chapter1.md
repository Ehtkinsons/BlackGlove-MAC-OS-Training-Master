Hardware and Software
---------------------

The tutorials in this course require the following hardware and software:

*   A Mac with macOS 11.0 or later and macOS Server 5.11 or later installed — Turn on the Profile Manager service in macOS Server. Set up the Mac to use a wired Ethernet connection as its only connection to the network. You can use Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet, but this connection might affect performance.
    
*   A second Mac with macOS 11.0 or later installed — You’ll use this Mac for different purposes in different tutorials. In some tutorials, you may use it as a client computer that’s managed by MDM. In others, you may use it to run additional tools, such as Apple Configurator 2.
    
*   iPhone with iOS 14 or later installed or iPad with iPadOS 14 or later installed.
    

### About Profile Manager

The tutorials in this course use Profile Manager to configure and distribute settings to Apple devices. MDM solutions are available from a wide range of vendors with a variety of features and hosting options for scalability in production environments. It’s recommended that you use a third-party MDM solution for production environments.

Important

The configuration changes in these tutorials may affect MDM settings, change the way a device works, and even erase the device. Don’t perform the steps in these tutorials using MDM production environments. It’s recommended that you use test devices.

Network Configuration
---------------------

You’ll need a wireless network to which all of the devices can connect and which provides access to Apple authentication servers and Apple Push Notification service (APNs). You’ll also need a static IP address on the network and corresponding domain name for the server.
