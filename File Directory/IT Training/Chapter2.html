                        nonpersonalized device deployment, IT administrators restrict the installed apps and personal

                    <h3>Shared iPad</h3>
                    <p>In iPadOS 13.4 or later, Shared iPad lets any user start a temporary session without entering a
                        user name or password. Users can tap Guest at the login screen and use the device. Shared iPad
                        deletes guest user data and browser history when the guest user logs out.</p>
                    <p>Guest users in a temporary session need to consider the temporary nature of their data if they’re
                        signed in to any websites or apps. Because guest users don’t use a Managed Apple ID, temporary
                        sessions may not support apps that use or require iCloud or cloud-based storage. Guest users
                        can’t modify account settings or sign in to Apple services during a temporary session on Shared
                        iPad.</p>

                    <h2>User Enrollment Model</h2>
                    <p>When users bring their personal devices — commonly referred to as a “bring your own device”
                        (BYOD) deployment — you can still provide access to organization services such as Wi-Fi, mail,
                        and calendars with MDM. Users set up and configure their devices after they enroll them in your
                        organization’s MDM solution. Enrolling grants users access to organization resources such as
                        configuration profiles, apps, and security settings. This enrollment type uses Managed Apple
                        IDs, which organizations own and manage. Managed Apple IDs provide the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>User access to Apple services</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Sign-in credentials for Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager roles</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can create Managed Apple IDs manually or automatically if you use federated authentication.

                    <p>User Enrollment integrates with Managed Apple ID to establish a user identity on the device. The
                        Managed Apple ID is part of the User Enrollment profile, and the user must successfully sign in
                        to complete enrollment. Users can use both their Managed Apple ID and their personal Apple ID on
                        the device without conflict.</p>

                    <h3>Device Enrollment</h3>
                    <p>When users enroll their personal devices in the MDM solution, IT administrators can manage many
                        different aspects of device use, including the ability to erase the device. Device Enrollment
                        also offers IT administrators a larger set of payloads and restrictions they can apply to the
                        device. When a user removes an enrollment profile, they also remove all configuration profiles,
                        settings, and managed apps related to the enrollment profile.</p>
