                <h2>Hardware and Software</h2>
                <p>The tutorials in this course require the following hardware and software:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A Mac with macOS 11.0 or later and macOS Server 5.11 or later installed — Turn on the Profile
                            Manager service in macOS Server. Set up the Mac to use a wired Ethernet connection as its
                            only connection to the network. You can use Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet, but this connection
                            might affect performance.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A second Mac with macOS 11.0 or later installed — You’ll use this Mac for different purposes
                            in different tutorials. In some tutorials, you may use it as a client computer that’s
                            managed by MDM. In others, you may use it to run additional tools, such as Apple
                            Configurator 2.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>iPhone with iOS 14 or later installed or iPad with iPadOS 14 or later installed.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>About Profile Manager</h3>
                <p>The tutorials in this course use Profile Manager to configure and distribute settings to Apple
                    devices. MDM solutions are available from a wide range of vendors with a variety of features and
                    hosting options for scalability in production environments. It’s recommended that you use a
                    third-party MDM solution for production environments.</p>

                    <p data-v-0c2f6c04="" class="label">Important</p>
                    <p data-v-0c2f6c04="">The configuration changes in these tutorials may affect MDM settings, change
                        the way a device works, and even erase the device. Don’t perform the steps in these tutorials
                        using MDM production environments. It’s recommended that you use test devices.</p>

                <h2>Network Configuration</h2>
                <p>You’ll need a wireless network to which all of the devices can connect and which provides access to
                    Apple authentication servers and Apple Push Notification service (APNs). You’ll also need a static
                    IP address on the network and corresponding domain name for the server.</p>
                <p>You’ll need a static IP address and corresponding domain name for the server. You’ll also need a
                    wireless or wired network to which all of the devices can connect and which provides access to Apple
                    authentication servers and APNs. For more information on access to Apple services, refer to <a

                <h2>Additional Requirements</h2>
                <p>Individual tutorials may have additional requirements and configurations listed in a <em>Set Up for
                        This Tutorial</em> section at the beginning of the tutorial. Even if you can’t meet all of a
                    tutorial’s resource requirements, you should still review the steps so that you’re familiar with the
                    covered procedures.</p>
