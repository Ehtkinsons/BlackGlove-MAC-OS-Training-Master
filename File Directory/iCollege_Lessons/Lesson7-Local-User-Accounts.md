* User accounts are managed in System Preferences
	+ `Apple Menu` -> `System Preferences` -> `Users & Groups`
	+ When creating an account you must provide:
		1. Account type
		2. Account attributes
* Five Types of User Accounts
	+ Administrator
	+ Standard
	+ Managed with Parental Controls
	+ Sharing-Only
	+ Group
* Administrator
	+ Unrestricted access to the system
	+ Most restrictions are still in place, but can be bypassed with authorization
	+ Initial account created during setup
	+ Elevated users privileges could lead to accidental changes/deletions on the system
	+ Should be used with care
	+ Many people prefer to use the account because of the easy system access
	+ Trade-off between convenience and security
* Standard
	+ Restricted access to system-wide settings
	+ Full access to their own profile
	+ Designed for shared systems
* Managed with Parental Controls
	+ Same as a standard user, but with Parental Controls restrictions applied
	+ Intended for children on a family computer
* Sharing-Only
	+ Accounts used for accessing shared folders
	+ Unable to logon to the physical machine
	+ No user profile
	+ Must access shared folders through the use of another machine
	+ Useful for a file server
* Group
	+ A container for multiple user accounts
	+ Allows assigning/modifying permissions on multiple people simultaneously
